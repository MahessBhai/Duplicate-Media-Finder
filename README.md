# Duplicate-Media-Finder: A Robust Solution for Detecting Duplicates in Images and Videos

## description
Duplicate Media Finder is a Python-based application designed to identify and remove duplicate images and videos from a directory or multiple directories. By leveraging cryptographic hash functions, this application efficiently scans media files, stores their checksums, and compares them across different runs, allowing for the detection of duplicates even when new files are added later.
